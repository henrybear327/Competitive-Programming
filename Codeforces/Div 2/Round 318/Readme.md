# Notes

### A

Just use priority_queue!

### B

It's important to think of the DS used to store the graph for query. Adj. matrix has a huge disadvantage when storing a graph with only few edges but lot's of vertex.

### C

Don't try to calculate the lcm(least common multiple) out, instead, look for patterns among input numbers!!!

Problem C is usually math problem, but relatively easy one. Don't mess it up next time!
