1. .vimrc, .bashrc
2. Use a fgets to get newline characters after a scanf before using fgets
3. Use len= strlen()
4. scanf() == 1, 2, 3...
5. Don't mess up indices, such as i, j, k
6. scanf() != EOF may fail!
7. Don't try to reduce code, think of every conditions that's possible and code them all.
7. Test cases with corner cases, such as 0, 1, -1. Also test the lower and upper bound of the testcases.
8. Read the problem statement carefully
9. Estimate time complexity
10. Find pattern, cycle
